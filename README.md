# Machine-scheduling

Studying solutions to the scheduling problem.

Given N tasks and 1 machine, one should find the scheduling that minimizes the average waiting time. The length of a task is predicted (given an error) by the machine.

In this project, we study and measure the quality of several solutions in respect the prediction error.
